# FindMyWheels-Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the FindMyWheels project, which is a smart system designed to locate cars in large parking lots. The system captures images using a mini car-like device and uses these images to detect car details such as number plate, color, make, and brand. This Python backend handles image processing, data management, and interacts with the Firebase Realtime Database to provide real-time parking analytics.
