# FindMyWheels-Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the FindMyWheels project, which is a smart system designed to locate cars in large parking lots. The system captures images using a mini car-like device and uses these images to detect car details such as number plate, color, make, and brand. This Python backend handles image processing and vehicle detection using Gemini-Vision, data management, and interacts with the Firebase Realtime Database to provide real-time parking analytics.

# How it works
The api.py handles all the API requests for car data processing. It communicates with the Firebase Realtime Database and processes the images with Gemini-Vision for detecting car details. This module is crucial for the real-time functionality of the FindMyWheels system.
